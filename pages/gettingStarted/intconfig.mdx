# ⚙️ Initial Configuration

Once you've invited the **Roblox-Discord Linking Bot** to your server, follow these steps for basic setup. This will help you get started with linking and verifying user accounts. You can expand these steps with more detailed configurations based on your needs.

## Basic Setup

1. **Run the Setup Command**: Use the `/setup` command to initialize the bot. This command will guide you through the basic setup for linking, verification, and any default role settings.
  
2. **Configure Verification Roles**: Decide which roles should be assigned to verified users. You can set this up in the initial setup or adjust it manually.

3. **Test the Linking Command**: Try the `/link` command with a test account to make sure that the bot properly links Roblox and Discord accounts and assigns roles.

### Example Usage

To set up the configuration, users might use the following command:

```
/config role:@Verified group_id:123456 verification_method:code
```

### Explanation

- **role**: Select a Discord role to assign to verified users.
- **group_id** (optional): Specify the Roblox group ID for group-based role syncing.
- **verification_method** (optional): Choose the type of verification method you want to use.
