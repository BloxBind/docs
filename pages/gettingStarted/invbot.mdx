# ðŸ“¥ Inviting the Bot to Your Server

Follow these simple steps to invite **BloxBind** to your Discord server and get started with account linking and verification.

## Step 1: Get the Invite Link

1. Go to the [Bot's Invite Page](<your-invite-link-here>).
2. Ensure youâ€™re logged into the correct Discord account with permissions to add bots to your server.

## Step 2: Choose Your Server

1. On the invite page, select the **server** you want to add the bot to from the drop-down menu.
2. Click **Continue** to proceed.

> **Note**: You need the "Manage Server" permission to invite bots to a server.

## Step 3: Grant Permissions

1. Youâ€™ll see a list of permissions that the bot requires, such as managing roles, reading messages, and sending messages.
2. **Review the permissions** and click **Authorize**.

> **Tip**: The botâ€™s default permissions are set to ensure all features work correctly. Custom permissions may limit certain functions.

## Step 4: Complete the Captcha

Once you click "Authorize," youâ€™ll be asked to complete a **captcha** to verify that youâ€™re not a bot. After completing this step, the bot should join your server!

## Step 5: Configure the Bot

Now that the bot is in your server:
1. Type `/setup` to start the initial setup.
2. Set up role linking and verification as needed for your community.
