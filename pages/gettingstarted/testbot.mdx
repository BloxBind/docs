# 🛠 Testing the Bot After Setup

After setting up the **Roblox-Discord Linking Bot**, it’s important to verify that everything works as expected. Here’s a quick guide to ensure that linking and verification features are functional.

## 📋 Basic Testing Steps

1. **Link a Test Account**  
   Use a test Discord account (or a trusted member’s account) to run the linking command:
   
   ```plaintext
   /link
   ```
   
   Follow the prompts to link a Roblox account with Discord. Make sure the bot responds correctly and initiates the verification process.

2. **Verify Role Assignment**  
   After the linking command completes, check the Discord server to confirm that the **verified role** is correctly assigned to the test account. This step ensures that the bot has the proper permissions to assign roles.

3. **Test Group-Based Role Syncing**  
   If you’ve configured group-based role syncing, confirm that the bot can detect the linked user’s roles from Roblox and assign the corresponding roles in Discord.

4. **Check Verification Logs**  
   If the bot logs verification actions to a specific channel, check that it logs the test account’s linking status. This is useful for tracking and troubleshooting in larger servers.

5. **Use Admin Commands**  
   If you have admin commands for managing bot configurations, test one to confirm it functions properly:

   ```plaintext
   /config view
   ```
   
   This command should display the bot’s current settings, confirming that admin commands are operational.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- **Permissions**: If roles aren’t assigned, ensure that the bot has the correct permissions (e.g., managing roles).
- **Verification Issues**: If linking doesn’t complete, confirm that the Roblox account is correctly set up and that any specified group ID is accurate.
- **Error Logs**: If you experience any errors, check the bot’s error logs (if available) or consult the support server for assistance.
